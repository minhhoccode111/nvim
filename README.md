# My Nvim Config

**Warning**: If you want to give these config a try, you should first fork this
repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t
blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own
risk!

This is a fork of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
which is a project to help me get started on my neovim journey.
